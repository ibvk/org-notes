Notes on using GNU Mailutils

* Working with GMail

There is a small problem with using GNU Mailutils with GMail.  GMail
servers (pop or imap) needs =@= character as part of the user name,
but GNU Mailutils uses =@= character to separate username and password
fields from server name.  So in a mailbox pattern like,

=imaps://username@gmail.com:password@imap.gmail.com/INBOX=

imap server name is parsed incorrectly as =gmail.com= instead of
correct =imap.gmail.com=.


This problem can be solved using =%40= in place of =@= character,
which is simply an ASCII equivalent representation in hex.  So above
mailbox pattern can be correctly specified as:

=imaps://username%40gmail.com:password@imap.gmail.com/INBOX=

Same applies to POP mailbox pattern too.
